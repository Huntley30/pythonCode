# A team member was trying to figure out a good time for 9 of us to all meet during the week; his mind exploaded when he typed all of our names
# into his calendar to view when we'd all be available. That got me thinking...what's the probability that we all have the same :30 minute slot
# available on our calendars? Likely very small...and likely not even worth thinking about...but I did. And I started to think harder and think 
# about the assumptions. 30 minute meeting, west coast and east coast teammates, 70% utilization for customer meetings so only 30% of the time
# could be available...
